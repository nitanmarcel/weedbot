# Contributing:

- The commands should work inline and by replying to a text.
- In bot_py you can find two folders: __inline__ and __reply__
  * As you can see there are multiple __.py__ files. That's our structure.
  * __inline/base.py__ is where we set the inline answer. __Please read the comments inside that file__ and also __look at the  others files inside the folder to find out how to make inline modules.__
  * The commands goes in the __reply__ folder and it will be automatically imported in the __ __main__ __ file
